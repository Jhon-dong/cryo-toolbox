This is a demonstration of the lead finding algorithm that is used to reference the L1 ATM elevation data from NSIDC (https://nsidc.org/data/ILATM1B/versions/1#) to the local sea surface height. The resulting data that uses this method is in an article (Mei & Maksym 2020) recently submitted to J. Remote Sensing.

All the data that is needed for this is in the Data/ directory. They are taken from NSIDC, and somewhat truncated (as the files are very big).
